# Crypter-go
a simple crypter written in Go language
This example uses the base64 encoding algorithm to encode and decode the original code. The main function takes the original code as a string, encodes it using base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString, and prints the resulting encoded code. Then, it decodes the encoded code using base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString and prints the resulting decoded code.

This crypter is a very simple example and is not meant to be used for any serious security purposes.
